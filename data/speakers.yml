  talk: "Lesson learned by 4 years of F# in production"
  bio: |
    <p>I'm a simple guy, who loves to code and do anything tech related. I like to
    spend time exploring new technologies and trying them on personal projects,
    but unfortunately, I rarely finish any of them. I also have an unhealthy
    interest in math and physics, although I'm pretty bad at both.</p>

    <p>And maybe
    the final thing that may sound interesting, in the last 3-4 years I'm
    participating in Bulgarian folk dance ensemble. We are often going on
    performance all over the country and couple of times abroad.</p>
