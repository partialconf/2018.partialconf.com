One of the great benefits of organising a conference is that you get to read
through all the proposals about new and exciting technologies upfront, so you
can choose the best content for the attendees. This year was no exception ‚Äì
we‚Äôve received some very interesting and thought-provoking presentations. Thank
you all for participating and being an amazing Œª community!

We are thrilled to announce the full lineup for 2018:

<% data.speakers.each do |speaker| %>
- [**<%= speaker.name %>** <small>(<%= speaker.tagline %>)</small>](/lineup#<%= speaker.name.parameterize %>)
<% end %>

You can read the full details on the [Lineup](/lineup) page.
