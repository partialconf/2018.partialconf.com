Hello, [partial][twitter] friends! üëã

You may have noticed our scarce presence during the last few months! No, we
were not on a quest to reinvent ourselves or put new life to our disregarded
stand-up comedy, deejaying and [rock star][vestimir] careers... ü•Å We were busy
running our sister event, [Balkan Ruby].

With [Balkan] out of the way, we're fully committed to Partial now. This
introduces a couple of changes. We have changed the date of the event to
accommodate our lateness. It's 30th of November now. Write this down! It is set
in [stone][vestimir-live]! ü§ò

With this, we're also prolonging our CFP to 13th of August. We're looking for
everything [Clojure], Erlang, [Haskell], [F#], [Reason], [React] and the likes!

<a href="/#cfp" class="btn-primary">Become a speaker</a>

Yours fully! ‚ù§Ô∏è
