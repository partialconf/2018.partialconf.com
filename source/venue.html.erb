        Generator opened its hall last year in the renovated Vitosha Factory.
        It is a playground for collaboration, inspiration and experience sharing
        between creatives, businesses and the public sector. Over the past few months
        Generator has hosted several workshops and meetups and we really liked the vibe
        of the place. It is a bright hall with lots of natural light, huge screen and
        functional, cozy interior.

        The location is well connected with public transport and the area has
        diverse restaurants, several hotels, shopping center, and a park.

        Here comes the South Park (not that one, sorry Kyle) â€“ one of the
        jewels of our town! Sofia really shines during the spring, so having a proper
        green patch near the venue was an important feat for us.
