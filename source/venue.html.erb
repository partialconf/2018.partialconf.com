    <h3>NDK a.k.a. The National Palace of Culture</h3>
    <p>The National Palace of Culture was built in 1981, to serve as a conference and exhibition centre for various events. The vast exhibition spaces, numerous halls, and spectacular view from the spacious balconies, contribute to its cult status.</p>
    <p>The park around NDK is known as one of the hot spots for youngsters (and not only) and is just few minutes walk from one of Sofia's vibrant pedestrian streets - Vitosha.</p>
    <p>There is a metro station, conveniently located right at the venue entrance. </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Hall 7</h3>
    <br />

    <p>Hall 7 is where Partial will take place. It's on the 5th floor and has lots of natural light and nice view of Sofia. </p>
